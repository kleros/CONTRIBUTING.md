# Introduction

## CONTRIBUTING.md?

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a living contribution and collaboration guide for all our projects.

Everyone, not just Kleros team members, is welcome to participate in its writing and editing. We are always looking to enhance and improve our processes so we can decentralize justice faster!

## Table of Contents

This guide is a compilation of years of experience in the fields of traditional software engineering, and smart contract and financial software auditing. We've broken it down into three parts:

| General Workflow | Smart Contract Workflow | Code Style & Guidelines | License & Code of Conduct |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| General process and standards for writing and pushing software. | Smart contract specific security protocols. | Stylistic guidelines for our main languages and tools. | Our standard license and conduct guidelines. |

## Referencing This Guide
