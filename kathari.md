# Kathari

## Making Everyone's Life Easier

To make following our standards easier, we made [Kathari](https://github.com/kleros/kathari).

{% hint style="info" %}
It means "Clean" in Greek.
{% endhint %}

It's a CLI that can easily be integrated into new projects to provide automatic linting and formatting that adheres to our standards on everything from code to git commit messages.

It's based on very popular open source technologies so there are integrations for all of the most popular text editors and IDEs.
